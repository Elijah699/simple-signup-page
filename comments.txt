1. Your signup border-radius is not the same as the image. You should have targeted top-left and bottom left for the blue and top right and bottom right for the green
2. Your indentation is bad.
3. Always include comments on your work.
4. No link on the signup/signin
5. All your styles should be external css
6. The signup button is too close to the I am a member already. And the button is too small compare to thee original
7. Compare the original design with urs there is a red background at the bottom of the page.
8. Gosh there is no responsiveness atall.
